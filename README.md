Description:  
"This project is a web-based application that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text, images, and files using RSA and RC4 algorithms. It features a user-friendly interface for secure data conversion, allowing users to:  

1. Convert plain text into ciphertext and vice versa using the RSA algorithm.  
2. Upload and encrypt image files (formats like .jpg, .jpeg, .png) using the RC4 algorithm.  
3. View encrypted content as ciphertext in a read-only text area.  
4. Utilize the FileReader API for encoding image data as Base64 for encryption.  

Use Cases:  
- Secure sensitive text and image data by converting it into an unreadable encrypted format.  
- Demonstrates the application of RSA for text encryption and RC4 for encrypting image and file data, showcasing practical cryptographic techniques."
